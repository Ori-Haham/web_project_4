**About the project**
The project simulates a profile page of a social network. The page is divided into several parts: Header, Profile-info, Content of images cards and Footer. In addition, there is a popup form that allows editing the personal information that appears in the profile.

the project is fully responsiv.

**Technologies**

In this project I used HTML, CSS and for the first time also JavaScript.

In order to make the project responsive, I used mainly Flexbox and Media-query.

I have also written a number of simple functions in JS which are triggered by click by  eventlistenr.

**Future Plans**


The next developments I intend to make in this project are to make the add-image and Like buttons active with the help of additional knowledge in JS I intend to acquire in the near future.
